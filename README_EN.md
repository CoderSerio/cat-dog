# Cat-Dog Classification

## Project Overview

This open-source repository presents a visualization tool for cat and dog image classification using Logistic Regression. Users should run `src/index.py` to train the model and generate the model file. After obtaining the model, users can execute `src/window.py` to launch the visualization window and perform cat-dog predictions on selected images.

### Main Contents

- **Dataset**: Please refer to the [Dataset](./data) for the preprocessed dataset containing thousands of cat and dog photographs.
- **Source Code**
   - Model Training & Generation: `src/index.py`
   - Visualization Window & Prediction: `src/window.py`

### Usage Instructions

1. Train the model and generate the model file:
   ```
   python src/index.py
   ```

2. Launch the visualization window and make predictions:
   ```
   python src/window.py
   ```

We welcome developers to fork, star or submit issues to collaboratively improve and enhance this cat-dog classification visualization tool! For detailed Chinese introduction, please refer to the [Chinese README](README.md).
